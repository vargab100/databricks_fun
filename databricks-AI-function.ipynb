Their Outback Oatmeal cookies are a perfect blend of chewy and crunchy, with a generous helping of oats and a hint of cinnamon that warms your palate.\n\nThe Austin Almond Biscotti is another standout, with its crisp texture and the nutty flavor of almonds.

Each bite is a burst of fruity goodness, making it a refreshing treat.\n\nHowever, the Golden Gate Ginger cookies were a bit too overpowering for my taste, with the ginger flavor dominating the palate.\n\nThe Tokyo Tidbits, on the other hand, were a pleasant surprise. These small, bite-sized cookies packed a punch with their unique blend of flavors.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try the Pearly Pies, but I've heard great things about them.\n\nOverall, Bakehouse is a must-visit for anyone in the Furukawa district. Their commitment to quality and unique flavor combinations make for a delightful culinary experience. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",

         "Bakehouse in Kaka'ako, Honolulu, sadly disappointed me. Their Outback Oatmeal was dry and crumbly, lacking the moist, chewy texture I crave in an oatmeal cookie. The Austin Almond Biscotti was overly hard, nearly chipping a tooth. Orchard Oasis, a disappointment, with a bland, uninspired flavor profile. Golden Gate Ginger, while promising, fell flat, lacking the spicy kick I associate with ginger. Tokyo Tidbits were forgettable, and Pearly Pies, while cute, were all style and no substance.
